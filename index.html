                <h2>Father of the Nation</h2>
                <p><b>Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi</b>, more popularly known as Mahatma Gandhi. His birth place was in the
                    small city of Porbandar in Gujarat (October 2, 1869 - January 30, 1948). Mahatma Gandhi's father's
                    name was Karamchand Gandhi, and his mother's name was Putlibai Gandhi. He was a politician, social
                    activist, Indian lawyer, and writer who became the prominent Leader of the nationwide surge movement
                    against the British rule of India. He came to be known as the Father of The Nation. October 2, 2023,
                    marks Gandhi Ji’s 154th birth anniversary, celebrated worldwide as International Day of
                    Non-Violence, and Gandhi Jayanti in India.


                    Gandhi Ji was a living embodiment of non-violent protests (Satyagraha) to achieve independence from
                    the British Empire's clutches and thereby achieve political and social progress. Gandhi Ji is
                    considered ‘The Great Soul’ or ‘The Mahatma’ in the eyes of millions of his followers worldwide. His
                    fame spread throughout the world during his lifetime and only increased after his demise. Mahatma
                    Gandhi, thus, is the most renowned person on earth.</p>
